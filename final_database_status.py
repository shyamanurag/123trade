Final Database Status Check

This script demonstrates that all the database schema issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ Fixed DatabaseSchemaManager with proper primary key handling
2. ✅ Fixed foreign key constraints for paper_trades table  
3. ✅ Enhanced database configuration for production environment
4. ✅ Created comprehensive migration script
5. ✅ Added proper transaction safety and error handling

The fixes address the ROOT CAUSES, not symptoms.
