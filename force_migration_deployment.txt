FORCE DEPLOYMENT - CRITICAL DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED

Timestamp: 2025-07-15 09:30:00
Issue: Paper trading system cannot save trades to database
Error: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn) column "id" does not exist
Current Deploy: deploy_1752570983_600e0121 (OLD - missing migration)

MIGRATION FIXES APPLIED (commits pushed):
- c4b74f4: Auto-migration runner added to startup
- 31b2209: Force deployment rebuild trigger
- 939d25e: Migration 009 - adds missing users.id column

REQUIRED: DigitalOcean must rebuild with latest commits to:
1. Apply database/migrations/009_fix_users_table_id_column.sql
2. Execute auto-migration during startup in src/core/database.py
3. Fix users table schema to enable paper trade persistence

This deployment rebuild is CRITICAL for restoring paper trading functionality.
Deployment must pull commits c4b74f4 and later to resolve the database schema issue.
