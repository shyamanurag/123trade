CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - MIGRATION 010 FIX
================================================

Timestamp: 2025-07-15 09:45:00
Issue: Paper trading database persistence failure
Error: Foreign key constraint preventing users table schema fix

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
- Previous migration 009 failed due to existing foreign key dependencies
- Users table has 'id' column but missing PRIMARY KEY constraint
- Foreign keys (trades_user_id_fkey, user_capital_user_id_fkey) depend on existing constraint
- Cannot drop existing constraint without CASCADE

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Created Migration 010: Safer approach that doesn't drop existing constraints
- Updated auto-migration runner to use migration 010 instead of 009
- Migration 010 intelligently handles existing schema without breaking dependencies

COMMIT: a8d5979 - "fix: add migration 010 to properly handle users table primary key constraint"

EXPECTED RESULT:
✅ Migration 010 will execute successfully during startup
✅ Users table will have proper PRIMARY KEY on id column
✅ Paper trading trades will save to database successfully  
✅ Frontend will display executed trades
✅ No more "column id does not exist" errors

This deployment rebuild is CRITICAL for restoring paper trading database persistence.
