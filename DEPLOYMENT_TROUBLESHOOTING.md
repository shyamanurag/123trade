# DigitalOcean Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: Build Success + Deployment Stuck

### Common Causes:
1. **Port Binding Issue**: App trying to bind to wrong port
2. **Database Connection Timeout**: App failing to connect to PostgreSQL  
3. **Memory Limits**: App exceeding allocated memory
4. **Environment Variable Issues**: Missing or malformed env vars
5. **Startup Timeout**: App taking too long to respond to health checks

### Quick Fixes:

#### Fix 1: Simplify Startup Process
Add these environment variables to reduce startup complexity:
```
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=true
SKIP_DB_INIT=true
```

#### Fix 2: Increase Resource Limits
In DigitalOcean App Settings:
- Increase memory to 1GB (from 512MB)
- Increase CPU to 1 vCPU
- Set health check timeout to 300 seconds

#### Fix 3: Fix Port Configuration
Ensure these environment variables are set:
```
PORT=8080
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

#### Fix 4: Emergency Rollback
If nothing works:
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Find last successful deployment
3. Click "Redeploy" on that version

### Runtime Log Errors to Look For:
- "Port already in use"
- "Connection refused" 
- "Timeout"
- "Memory limit exceeded"
- "Health check failed"
