CRITICAL: DigitalOcean deployment sync issue detected

Latest local commit: 1e1cc05
Deployed version appears to be running older code

Evidence:
- Risk manager returns: risk_manager_not_initialized  
- Expected: working_minimal_risk_manager_active
- Missing orchestrator fields: symbol_count, system_ready, strategies_loaded

Required: Fresh deployment to sync latest code with production
