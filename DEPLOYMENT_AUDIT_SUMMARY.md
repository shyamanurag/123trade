## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🟢 Immediate Actions (Optional - System is Healthy)

1. **Zerodha Environment Setup** (if you want to use real trading):
   ```bash
   # Run the setup script we created
   python setup_zerodha_environment.py
   ```
   - Configure ZERODHA_API_KEY, ZERODHA_API_SECRET, ZERODHA_USER_ID
   - Set up local Redis for development

2. **Frontend Framework Detection** (cosmetic improvement):
   - The React/Vite detection is not critical, but you could add meta tags if desired
