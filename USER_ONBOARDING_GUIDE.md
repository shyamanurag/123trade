# üë• USER ONBOARDING GUIDE

## üéØ **TWO ONBOARDING APPROACHES AVAILABLE**

Your trading system supports **both centralized and decentralized** user onboarding:

---

## üìã **APPROACH 1: SIMPLE ONBOARDING (RECOMMENDED FOR START)**

### **What New Users Need to Provide:**
1. **Trading System Account**:
   - Username (for your platform)
   - Password (for your platform) 
   - Email address

2. **Zerodha Login Credentials**:
   - Client ID (e.g., QSW899)
   - Login Password
   - *(Just their regular Zerodha login)*

### **How It Works:**
- ‚úÖ **Your master API key handles all connections**
- ‚úÖ **Users authenticate through your system**
- ‚úÖ **Centralized trade management**
- ‚úÖ **Simple setup process**

### **Onboarding Steps:**
1. User visits your platform
2. User registers (username/email/password)
3. User provides Zerodha credentials  
4. System authenticates them via master API
5. **Ready to trade!**

### **Current Configuration:**
```env
# Your master credentials (already configured)
ZERODHA_API_KEY=sylcoq492qz6f7ej
ZERODHA_API_SECRET=jm3h4iejwnxr4ngmma2qxccpkhevo8sy
```

## üìã **APPROACH 2: INDIVIDUAL API KEYS (FOR ADVANCED USERS)**

### **What New Users Need to Provide:**
1. **Trading System Account**:
   - Username (for your platform)
   - Password (for your platform)
   - Email address

2. **Their Own Kite Connect Credentials**:
   - Personal API Key (from their Kite Connect app)
   - Personal API Secret (from their Kite Connect app)

### **How It Works:**
- ‚úÖ **Each user has their own API connection**
- ‚úÖ **Independent rate limits per user**
- ‚úÖ **Better regulatory compliance**
- ‚úÖ **User controls their own API access**

### **Onboarding Steps:**
1. User visits your platform
2. User registers (username/email/password)
3. **User creates Kite Connect app:**
   - Go to https://developers.zerodha.com/
   - Login with their Zerodha credentials
   - Create new app
   - Get API Key & Secret
4. User provides API credentials to your system
5. **Ready to trade!**

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **Ready for Approach 1:**
```python
# Already implemented in user_manager.py
- User registration ‚úÖ
- Authentication ‚úÖ 
- Master API integration ‚úÖ
- Redis user storage ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ **Ready for Approach 2:**
```python
