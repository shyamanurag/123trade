CRITICAL ORDER EXECUTION FIXES APPLIED:
1. Fixed Zerodha token retrieval in orchestrator (commit 7ba658d)
2. Added comprehensive Redis token search patterns
3. Set mock_mode=False when valid credentials available
4. Added ACTIVE_USER_ID environment variable
5. Fixed missing os import in trade_engine.py

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Zerodha client should initialize in LIVE mode
- Orders should execute with real API credentials
- System should use PAPER_TRADER_MAIN as active user
- Trade count should increase

DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED: Force fresh deployment to activate fixes
